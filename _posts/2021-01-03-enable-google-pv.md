This post is to enable Page Views on the [**Chirpy**][chirpy-homepage] theme based blog that you just built. This requires technical knowledge and it's recommended to keep the `google_analytics.pv.*` empty unless you have a good reason. If your website has low traffic, the page views count would discourage you to write more blogs. With that said, let's start with the setup.
